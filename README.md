# Digital Communication 2 Project

## Adaptive Predistortion
The goal of the project is to implement a block, called a predistorter, to be applied to a signal that will later be amplified by a nonlinear amplifier. Due to its nonlinearity, the amplifier will broaden the spectrum of the processed signal and reduce the BER. The concept of the predistorter is to create a nonlinear amplifier whose transfer function is the inverse of the actual amplifier. The amplifier can be mathematically modeled using the Rapp model.
